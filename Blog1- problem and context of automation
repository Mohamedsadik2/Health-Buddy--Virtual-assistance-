The Problem and Context of Health Management
Managing health can be really hard in today's busy world. With work, family, and other commitments, it’s easy to let health tasks slip through the cracks. Let’s talk about the common problems people face when trying to keep their health on track.

Missed Medical Appointments
A big issue is missing medical appointments. Keeping track of all the doctor’s visits can be overwhelming, especially for people with chronic conditions who need to go often. Missing these appointments can mess up treatment plans and lead to worse health.

Common Causes:
•	Forgetting the appointments, especially among the elderly.
•	No system to keep all appointments organized.
•	Busy schedules and overlapping commitments.
Impact:
•	Delayed treatments and follow-ups.
•	Higher risk of health problems getting worse.
•	Increased healthcare costs due to emergency visits.

Inconsistent Medication Intake

Taking medications as prescribed is crucial, but many people struggle with it. This is especially true for those who have to take multiple medications.

Common Causes:
•	Forgetting to take medications.
•	Confusion about dosages and timing.
•	No reminders or support systems in place.
Impact:
•	Treatments not working as well as they should.
•	Higher risk of complications and hospital visits.
•	Increased healthcare costs.


Lack of Immediate Health Advice
When health issues come up, getting quick, reliable advice is really important. But many people don’t have easy access to this kind of help and often turn to the internet, which can provide misleading information.

Common Causes:
•	Limited access to healthcare professionals.
•	Reliance on unreliable internet sources.
•	Difficulty finding accurate information.
Impact:
•	Delayed or inappropriate treatments.
•	Increased anxiety and stress.

Keeping track of important health metrics like weight, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels is essential but can be tough to do consistently.

Common Causes:
•	Lack of time and resources.

•	No access to advanced health monitoring tools.
Impact:
•	Incomplete health data for doctors to work with.

Managing Multiple Health Records
Keeping track of medical history, test results, and treatment plans from different doctors can be confusing and lead to lost information.

Common Causes:
•	No centralized system for health records.

Impact:

Impact:

Impact:

•	Language barriers.
Impact:
•	Mismanagement of health conditions.

Impact:
