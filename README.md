# Personal Connection to the Health Buddy

My inspiration for delving into the realm of virtual health assistance stems from my personal experiences with my uncle, who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Seeing how hard it is for him to deal with his condition every day makes me really want to find new ways to help him live better.

One of the most pressing issues my uncle encounters is remembering his treatment appointments. Due to the cognitive effects of Alzheimer's, he often forgets important medical visits, which can lead to lapses in his care regimen. Additionally, he struggles to recall details of his symptoms or communicate any discomfort he may be experiencing.

This is where the concept of a virtual health assistant, or "Health Buddy," becomes invaluable. By integrating features such as appointment reminders and symptom tracking, the app can serve as a reliable companion for my uncle, helping him stay on top of his healthcare needs even in the face of memory challenges. If he feels any pain or notices symptoms, he can simply voice his concerns to Health Buddy, which will record the information for future reference. This ensures that even if my uncle forgets what he experienced, we can still access vital information by referring back to the app.

Health Buddy goes beyond just symptom tracking by combine wearable device integration to monitor my uncle's vital signs. This continuous data collection generates comprehensive reports that provide insights into his health status, even when he may not be able to articulate it himself. With this proactive approach to healthcare management, we can ensure that my uncle's well-being remains under control, even in the face of Alzheimer's-related memory loss.

## Automated Symptom Tracker 

We  can use this automation code to ensure receiveing regular reminders to record the symptoms

import tkinter as tk
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import csv
import threading

def record_symptoms(symptoms):
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    with open('symptoms.csv', 'a', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow([timestamp] + symptoms)
    print("Symptoms recorded successfully.")

def submit_symptoms():
    symptoms = entry_symptoms.get().split(',')  # Assuming symptoms are entered as comma-separated values
    record_symptoms(symptoms)
    label_feedback.config(text="Symptoms recorded successfully.")

def scheduled_reminder():
    threading.Timer(24 * 3600, scheduled_reminder).start()  # Remind every 24 hours
    # You can customize the reminder message here
    print("Reminder: Don't forget to record your symptoms!")

# Create GUI window
window = tk.Tk()
window.title("Health Buddy - Symptom Tracker")

# Create input field for symptoms
label_symptoms = tk.Label(window, text="Enter symptoms (comma-separated):")
label_symptoms.pack()
entry_symptoms = tk.Entry(window)
entry_symptoms.pack()

# Create submit button
button_submit = tk.Button(window, text="Submit", command=submit_symptoms)
button_submit.pack()

# Create feedback label
label_feedback = tk.Label(window, text="")
label_feedback.pack()

# Start scheduled reminders
scheduled_reminder()

# Start GUI event loop
window.mainloop()
